title: Using Custom Telematics Devices
---

Geotab provides the ability to use custom telematics devices in MyGeotab. A custom telematics device is any device that is not a Geotab GO Device but is used in conjunction with Geotabâ€™s fleet management platform and is capable of providing its own positional (e.g. GPS) data.

# Getting Started

Integrating a custom telematics device with MyGeotab requires the use of the [Data Intake Gateway](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15uNuPqwFcPLe6vKs_JgY5nPTy2isQ3WYUu4oyQ3cEfQ){:target="_blank"}. Refer to the [Custom Telematics Devices and MyGeotab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mddnxc2qKBCNYvVu0-BXcyR-blPlHwa0Zun0mBzZt88){:target="_blank"} document for a high-level overview of the registration process.
